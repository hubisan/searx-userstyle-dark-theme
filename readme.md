# Searx Dark Theme

This is a dark theme for [searx](https://asciimoo.github.io/searx/) the free internet metasearch engine. This theme can be applied to your browser from [userstyles](https://userstyles.org/styles/138093/searx-dark-theme-for-theme-oscar-logicodev) with an add-on or by installing it manually.

It includes some minor improvements to the user interface.
